# unoSimulator
Hello, 

This project is to simulate Uno in java.

Currently has Card class for handling cards, Deck class for handling deck, Game class for tying everything together and UnoTester for running tests.

Plan is to add more and more AIs to it to figure out what's the most optimal strategy for winning.

Thanks for reading.
